<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Rishi this side. I am a very ordinary guy from Kolkata, the city of joy.<br/>
   But I really have extraordinary visions and an aim to improve the world and make it a safer and a better place to live in.<br/>
    I am a sophomore at NIT Rourkela studying engineering. My interests apart from academics are diverse. I am a space enthusiast and like to read a lot of books on space and new innovations and technologies of that field. I have a knack towards geopolitics, economics and finances (specifically about Algo-trading). I am also a coder in java and python and a web developer with Hackathon experiences. I am a great admirer of music too, I play 4 instruments and like to hear to good classical music in peace. With the advancing AI, I am also learning Prompt Engineering. So, other than science, I spend most of the time in learning about the world economics, business and other successful figures who inspire me to work hard more.
   Lastly, I want to state I am a good learner and I can learn things fast and I am also a very curious person who have the hunger to learn things if once get into my good attention.</p>
